BruneiCodex is a **self-evolving knowledge platform** about Brunei. It is built for anyone navigating life here — residents, expats, newcomers, and businesses.

Every entry is source-linked, date-verified, and continuously maintained by an AI system that monitors for staleness, inaccuracy, and coverage gaps. This is not a blog. It is a living body of knowledge that grows, corrects, and deepens over time.

## What Makes This Different

- **AI-Verified**: Every factual claim is checked against official sources before publication and re-checked on defined cadences.
- **Self-Evolving**: The platform detects coverage gaps, monitors source freshness, and prioritizes new content automatically.
- **Living Knowledge**: Entries have a lifecycle — draft, verified, stale-risk, needs-refresh. Nothing pretends to be current when it isn't.
- **Source-Mapped**: Every claim links to its source with confidence tagging (official, institutional, or secondary).

## What We Cover

BruneiCodex covers 12 guide categories spanning daily life in Brunei:

Living · Working · Business · Education · Health · Culture · Activities · Events · Food · Movies · Home Services · Gadgets

## Editorial Principles

- Neutral tone, practical focus, answer-first structure
- No hidden promotions, no political commentary, no unsourced claims
- Clear attribution and source linking for every factual statement
- If something changes, we update the entry and refresh the dates

## Trust Model

Every entry shows:
- **Published date** and **last updated** date
- **Verified on** date — when sources were last checked
- **Content state** — whether the entry is verified, draft, or needs refresh
- **Source list** — links to official sources backing each claim
