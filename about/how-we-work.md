BruneiVerse publishes practical guides with a simple goal: be clear, be current, and be fair.

## Editorial Workflow

1. Pick high-intent topics with practical user need.
2. Draft answer-first guides with step-by-step sections, pricing tables, and FAQs.
3. Add official source links for rules, policies, and institutional information.
4. Run a quality checklist before publishing.
5. Refresh pages when information changes.

## Business Model

- Current model: ad-supported content.
- Future model: a directory with disclosed sponsored placements.
- Sponsored entries will be clearly labeled as `Featured` or `Sponsored`.

## Ranking and Recommendations

When a guide compares options, we focus on factual criteria such as process clarity, cost bands, coverage, and availability. We do not publish hidden rankings tied to payments.

## Corrections

If a guide becomes outdated or incorrect, we update it and refresh the `last updated` date. When something is time-sensitive (prices, schedules, contact details), we re-check it before publishing.
