BruneiCodex is a self-evolving knowledge platform maintained by an AI system. Here is how it works.

## Verification Process

Every entry goes through a verification pipeline before publication:

1. **Source discovery** — official government, regulator, and institutional sources are identified
2. **Claim mapping** — every factual statement is linked to its source with a confidence tag
3. **Freshness check** — time-sensitive claims (prices, schedules, regulations) are verified within 7-30 days of publication
4. **Quality gate** — structure, tone, SEO, internal linking, and compliance checks must all pass
5. **Continuous monitoring** — published entries are re-checked on cadence; stale entries are flagged and refreshed

## Content Lifecycle

Every entry has a visible state:

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Verified** | Fully sourced, passes all quality gates, publish-ready |
| **Draft** | In production, not yet fully verified |
| **Stale-risk** | Approaching verification timeout |
| **Needs-refresh** | Verification expired or source changed |
| **Archived** | Retained for context, clearly labeled as not current |

## Business Model

- Current model: ad-supported content
- Future model: a directory with clearly labeled `Featured` or `Sponsored` placements
- Rankings and recommendations are never secretly influenced by payment

## Disclosures

If a page includes sponsored content or affiliate links, it is labeled clearly near the top. No exceptions.

## Corrections

- Confirmed factual errors are patched within 24-72 hours
- Corrections are logged with a date and change note
- If a claim cannot be safely corrected, it is removed until re-verified
