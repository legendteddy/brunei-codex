---

BruneiVerse publishes practical guides with a simple goal: be clear, be current, and be fair.

## What You Can Expect

- Guides are written in a neutral tone.
- Time-sensitive details (prices, schedules, contact info) are re-checked when we update a page.
- We link sources where possible, especially for official rules and processes.

## Business Model

- Current model: ad-supported content.
- Future model: a directory with clearly labeled sponsored placements.

## Disclosures

- If a page includes sponsored content or affiliate links in the future, it will be labeled clearly near the top of the page.
- We do not publish hidden rankings tied to payments.

## Corrections

If you spot something outdated or wrong, we want to fix it quickly. When a correction is made, we update the `last updated` date.
