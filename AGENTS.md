# AGENTS.md - BruneiVerse Agent Playbook

## 1) Project Snapshot
- Brand: BruneiVerse
- Live URL: `https://legendteddy.github.io/bruneiverse/`

- Prioritize practical, factual, action-oriented guidance.
- Keep tone neutral and non-promotional.
- Use clear structure and answer-first writing.
- Cite official sources for policies, regulations, or institutional claims.
- Prefer comprehensive depth over thin volume.

## 4) Required Guide Contract

tags: [tag1, tag2, tag3]
meta_description: "Everything you need to know about [topic] in Brunei. Updated [YEAR]. Costs, process, tips, and recommendations."

### Secondary (authority depth)

- Geography/history background (factual only)
- Language basics

## 7) Linking and SEO Rules
- URL pattern: `/guides/[topic-slug-in-brunei]/`
- Title format: `[Topic] in Brunei - Complete Guide [YEAR]`
- Meta description format from section 4.1
- Every guide links to at least 3 related internal guides
- Use descriptive anchor text
- Keep `last_updated` current when edits are made

## 8) Operating Cadence

2. Run quality gate.
3. Add internal links.
4. Publish with complete front matter and sources.

### Weekly (30-45 min)
1. Internal link audit (no broken internal paths).
2. Metadata audit (`meta_description`, `last_updated`).
3. Regenerate/verify sitemap.
4. Review broken external links.

### Monthly (1-2 hours)
1. Review coverage and freshness.
2. Update outdated prices/processes/regulations.
3. Prioritize next topic cluster.
