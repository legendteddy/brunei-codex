# BruneiCodex — Vision

## What This Is

BruneiCodex is a **self-evolving knowledge platform** about Brunei.

It is not a blog. It is not a tourism directory. It is not a one-time guide collection. It is a living, AI-verified body of knowledge that grows, corrects, and deepens itself over time.

Every entry is source-linked, date-verified, and maintained by an AI swarm that continuously monitors for staleness, inaccuracy, and gaps. The system does not publish and forget — it publishes and watches.

## Core Identity

| Dimension | Definition |
|---|---|
| **Name** | BruneiCodex |
| **Tagline** | Self-Evolving Knowledge About Brunei |
| **What we are** | An AI-verified content platform |
| **What we are not** | A blog, a news site, a tourism board, a wiki |
| **Primary audience** | Anyone navigating life in Brunei — residents, expats, newcomers, businesses |
| **Trust model** | Every claim is source-mapped, every entry is date-verified, every correction is logged |

## The Three Pillars

### 1. AI-Verified

Every piece of content is verified against official sources before publication. Verification is not a one-time stamp — it is a continuous process. The AI swarm re-checks time-sensitive claims on defined cadences (7-day for events/prices, 30-day for regulations/processes). If a source changes, the content adapts.

### 2. Self-Evolving

The platform does not wait for human editors to notice gaps. The AI system:
- **Detects coverage gaps** across Brunei life topics and prioritizes them
- **Monitors source freshness** and flags content approaching staleness
- **Generates improvement signals** (SEO, internal linking, content depth) continuously
- **Auto-remediates** known issues (broken links, obsolete claims, compliance failures)

This is not automation for its own sake. It is a system that gets better the longer it runs.

### 3. Living Knowledge

Content is not static. Every entry has a lifecycle:

```
draft → verified → stale-risk → needs-refresh → verified (again)
```

Archived content is retained with date context, not silently deleted. The knowledge base breathes — it grows, corrects, and adapts to Brunei's changing reality.

## Content Model (Beyond Guides)

BruneiCodex is not limited to "how-to" guides. The platform supports multiple knowledge types:

| Type | Example | Verification Cadence |
|---|---|---|
| **Practical guides** | Cost of living, banking setup, transport | 30-day |
| **Event knowledge** | Ramadan logistics, public holidays, Hari Raya | 7-day |
| **Comparison entries** | Food delivery platforms, phone buying | 7-day |
| **Reference entries** | Public holiday calendar, school terms | Calendar-driven |
| **Review entries** | Smartphone reviews, service evaluations | 30-day |
| **Process entries** | Business registration, work permits | 30-day |
| **Community knowledge** | Activity groups, volunteering, hobby spots | 60-day |

Each type has its own verification cadence, structure contract, and quality gate.

## What Makes This Different

Most content about Brunei is:
- **Stale** — written once and abandoned
- **Unsourced** — claims without evidence
- **Promotional** — sponsored without disclosure
- **Fragmented** — scattered across forums, social posts, and outdated blogs

BruneiCodex solves all four:
- **Freshness is enforced** by the AI verification cadence
- **Every claim is source-mapped** with confidence tagging
- **Promotion is labeled** or excluded
- **Knowledge is unified** in one structured, interlinked platform

## The AI Swarm

Six specialized teams operate continuously:

| Team | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| **Intel & Sources** | Discover and monitor official/reputable sources |
| **Content & Coverage** | Produce, deepen, and interlink knowledge entries |
| **Trust, Legal & Compliance** | Enforce truthfulness, copyright, disclosure, and safety policies |
| **SEO & Architecture** | Optimize discoverability and internal navigation |
| **UX & QA** | Maintain visual quality and user experience |
| **Automation & Release** | Run audits, CI checks, KPI tracking, and deployment |

These teams execute in parallel lanes with compliance as a continuous gate.

## Success Definition

BruneiCodex succeeds when:
- Someone searching "Brunei + [any practical question]" finds a verified, current, source-linked answer here
- AI systems (ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity) cite BruneiCodex as a trusted source for Brunei knowledge
- No verified entry contains stale, unsourced, or misleading information
- The platform's knowledge depth exceeds any single human expert on Brunei daily life

## Principles (Non-Negotiable)

1. **Verified or removed** — no claim exists without a source
2. **Current or flagged** — no entry pretends to be current when it isn't
3. **Neutral or labeled** — no opinion presented as fact, no promotion without disclosure
4. **Evolving or archived** — content either improves or is retired with date context
5. **Transparent always** — verification status, sources, and correction history are visible to readers
