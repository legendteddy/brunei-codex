# Ramadan in Brunei - Complete Guide

**Quick Answer:** Plan Ramadan in Brunei using official daily updates. The 1447H moon-sighting exercise is scheduled for 2026-02-17 and final confirmation should be followed from official announcements and broadcasts, not informal messages [Source: RTB News 2026-01-29]. If you are new to Brunei, focus on prayer/meal timing, adjusted operating hours, and clear social etiquette.

## Overview

Ramadan in Brunei is highly structured, but daily life still depends on announcement timing and local operating practices. For practical planning, split your preparation into three layers:

1. Official status checks (start date, key observances, public-holiday updates).
2. Daily logistics (work schedule, meals, transport, essential errands).
3. Social etiquette (public behavior, invitations, and event planning).

What this looks like in real life: if you are arranging a client meeting in late February 2026, set two possible dates and confirm after the moon-sighting result is announced. This avoids last-minute changes.

## Key Information

| Item | Latest Status on 2026-02-14 | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ramadan 1447 moon sighting | Scheduled for Tuesday, 2026-02-17 [Source: RTB News 2026-01-29] | Keep evening schedule flexible on 2026-02-17 |
| Official information channel | MORA announcements page [Source: MORA Semua Pengumuman] | Check directly before sharing dates |
| Public-holiday school calendar context | 2026 MOE calendar includes Ramadan/Hari Raya entries marked subject to moon-sighting outcomes [Source: MOE Calendar 2026 PDF] | Treat as planning reference, then confirm final |
| Sample Ramadan operating-hour adjustment | BKISHHB publishes separate Ramadan visiting hours [Source: BKISHHB Visit Info] | Verify each place you plan to visit |

| Planning Area | Practical Baseline | Verification Rhythm |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Work meetings | Use shorter daytime windows | Confirm same day |
| Errands | Prioritize early slots | Re-check opening hours 24h before |
| Social visits | Confirm host timing and meal plan | Confirm 1 day before |
| Family routines | Plan sahur/iftar prep early | Weekly adjustment |

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Set your verification stack first

Use three priority checks:

1. RTB and official channels for moon-sighting outcomes [Source: RTB News 2026-01-29].
2. MORA announcement page for religious/public guidance updates [Source: MORA Semua Pengumuman].
3. Agency or venue pages for opening-hour differences (not all services run normal hours) [Source: BKISHHB Visit Info].

This prevents the most common mistake: circulating unverified timing screenshots.

### 2. Build a flexible first-week schedule

For your first Ramadan week in Brunei, avoid rigid back-to-back commitments. Keep:

- Work-critical tasks in early office windows.
- Non-urgent tasks outside peak transition times.
- Meal prep and family logistics pre-planned for at least 3 days at a time.

Editorial guidance: if your workload is high, block two short recovery windows during the day rather than one long break.

### 3. Plan etiquette before social invites

If you are hosting colleagues or friends:

- Confirm dietary needs early.
- Send clear start/end times.
- Do not assume everyone follows the same routine.

Etiquette in Brunei during Ramadan is generally respectful and practical. When unsure, ask directly and keep plans simple.

### 4. Track changes through to Hari Raya transition

Ramadan planning should include transition planning for Hari Raya days. The MOE 2026 calendar is useful as a planning indicator, but still marks key Islamic dates as subject to change based on moon-sighting outcomes [Source: MOE Calendar 2026 PDF].

## Costs and Pricing

`Planning estimate:` Ramadan cost patterns usually shift, not always increase. Your total can rise if you add frequent hosted meals and extra travel.

| Budget Line | Typical Change Pattern | Planning Control |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Groceries | Can rise due to iftar/sahur prep | Pre-plan 3-5 day menus |
| Dining and gatherings | Can rise if hosting frequently | Set weekly event cap |
| Transport | Varies by routine shift | Group errands by area |
| Utilities | Can rise with changed home occupancy | Track weekly, not monthly only |

What this looks like: a household that normally shops daily often spends less volatility-wise by switching to two structured grocery runs per week.

## Tips and Recommendations

- Treat all date-sensitive posts as unverified until matched with official channels.
- Keep one short checklist note on your phone: announcements, opening hours, transport, and guest coordination.
- If a venue publishes Ramadan-specific timing, follow that page directly and avoid third-party reposts [Source: BKISHHB Visit Info].
- Keep at least one backup meal/errand plan for the first week.
- If you are new in Brunei, align Ramadan planning with your broader setup guides: [Cost of Living in Brunei]({{ '/guides/cost-of-living-brunei/' | relative_url }}), [Getting Around Brunei]({{ '/guides/getting-around-brunei-transport/' | relative_url }}), and [Healthcare in Brunei]({{ '/guides/healthcare-in-brunei/' | relative_url }}).
