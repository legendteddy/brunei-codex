meta_description: "Everything you need to know about work permit and visa process in Brunei. Updated 2026. Steps, documents, timelines, costs, and risk controls."
quick_answer: "In Brunei, employment approval is a two-agency process: labour-side authorization first, then immigration-side work visa/work pass processing. Most delays come from incomplete document packs, inconsistent employer records, or expired passport validity windows. If your employer uses a checklist and submits in the right sequence, the process is straightforward and predictable."

# Work Permit and Visa Process in Brunei - Complete Guide

**Quick Answer:** Brunei work authorization generally runs in sequence: labour licensing/approval followed by immigration visa and work pass steps. Immigration’s Work Pass section lists visa/work pass applications, renewals, cancellations, and dependent-related processing under one service area [Source: Immigration Work Pass Division]. For most applicants, the highest-impact controls are complete documents, valid passport (minimum validity buffer), and correct employer-side labour approvals before immigration submission [Source: Immigration Work Pass Division; Source: MFA Working in Brunei].

## Overview

If you are moving to Brunei for employment, the process feels complex only when agencies are mixed up or submissions are out of order. In practice, you can treat it as one operational pipeline with checkpoints.

What this looks like in real life: an employer that secures labour-side approvals first and then submits a complete immigration package usually avoids avoidable rework. An employer that submits early with missing items often gets delayed by multiple clarification rounds.

For planning purposes:

1. Employer readiness and labour-side approvals come first.
2. Immigration work visa/work pass processing follows.
3. Post-approval endorsement and continuation/renewal controls keep status valid.

## Key Information

| Process Area | Official Signal | Practical Impact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Immigration Work Pass scope | Immigration Work Pass division handles new applications, extensions, cancellations, and dependent-related processing [Source: Immigration Work Pass Division] | Confirms where immigration-side case handling sits |
| Required document baseline | Immigration lists employer letter, passport validity, Form 23/photos, and labour-side licence/job-order dependencies [Source: Immigration Work Pass Division] | Helps reduce rejection/rework risk |
| Labour licensing channel | Labour department notes Foreign Worker License (LPA) submissions through NLMS flow [Source: Labour Services page] | Sets labour-side process expectation |
| Entry/visa context | MFA working-in-Brunei page summarizes employment visa requirement and employer quota/work-pass prerequisites [Source: MFA Working in Brunei] | Useful external-facing summary for pre-arrival planning |

| Main Stage | Owner | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Employer preparation | Employer/agent | Role definition + candidate pack |
| Labour authorization | Employer/agent with Labour process | Worker licence and related approvals |
| Immigration submission | Employer/agent | Work visa/work pass decision flow |
| Endorsement/activation | Employer/agent + applicant | Endorsed work status |
| Ongoing compliance | Employer + employee | Renewal/continuation validity |

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Confirm role and employer pathway

Before document collection, confirm whether the role goes through standard labour + immigration flow or sector-specific support pathways. For example, the energy sector publishes additional LPA support-letter workflow before labour/immigration submission in certain cases [Source: Energy LPA].

Editorial guidance: do this early. Wrong pathway assumptions create the longest delays.

### 2. Build the document pack from official requirements

The Immigration Work Pass page lists key submission items including:

- Employer/guarantor application letter.
- Valid employee passport with minimum validity window.
- Form 23 and photos where required.
- Labour-side licence references (including LPA/BUR500 context and recruitment/job-order references) [Source: Immigration Work Pass Division].

Do not treat this as a checklist you can partially complete. Submitting incomplete packs usually triggers avoidable clarification cycles.

### 3. Complete labour-side approvals before immigration filing

Labour-side authorization is not optional. Labour department service notes identify Foreign Worker License (LPA/FWL) channel expectations and NLMS-based submission logic [Source: Labour Services page].

Once labour-side prerequisites are in place, the immigration work pass process becomes much more predictable.

### 4. Submit immigration work visa/work pass application

Immigration’s Work Pass division handles new applications and related lifecycle actions. The same section also covers extension and cancellation pathways [Source: Immigration Work Pass Division].

For planning, include:

1. Submission date.
2. Document reconciliation date.
3. Decision follow-up date.
4. Endorsement and arrival/activation date.

### 5. Prepare endorsement and post-approval controls

After approval, endorsement and continuation obligations matter. Immigration documentation includes categories for new endorsement, continuation endorsement, change of employer, and cancellation procedures [Source: Immigration Work Pass Division].

This is where many employers lose compliance discipline. Keep a structured status tracker with expiry dates, renewal lead time, and agency contact references.

## Costs and Pricing

`Planning estimate:` exact employer and applicant costs vary by case type, visa category, and agency requirements. Use official fee references from current agency channels before payment.

| Cost Component | What to Expect | Verification Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Government processing fees | Case-dependent and can vary by category | Confirm current fee tables directly with responsible agency pages/counters |
| Employer/agency admin costs | Internal process and service dependent | Ask for itemized quote in writing |
| Medical/reporting document costs | Depends on required tests and provider | Confirm accepted report format before booking |
| Re-entry/continuation costs | Triggered by lifecycle events | Build renewal budget window in advance |

MFA’s external summary page references a BND 20 fee context in embassy workflow examples and highlights that requirements are case-dependent [Source: MFA Working in Brunei]. Treat it as directional context, then verify the exact payable amount for your channel and nationality before transaction.

## Tips and Recommendations

- Sequence beats speed: labour-side readiness before immigration submission avoids rework.
- Keep every document in one controlled version folder (passport copy, forms, letters, approvals).
- Set passport validity checks early; low validity near submission date is a common avoidable blocker [Source: Immigration Work Pass Division].
- Employers should track every worker by expiry calendar, not by memory.
- For applicants, ask for written status updates at each stage to reduce uncertainty.

## Common Questions (FAQ)
