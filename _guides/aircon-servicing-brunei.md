# Aircon Servicing in Brunei - Complete Guide

**Quick Answer:** In Brunei's tropical climate, residential aircons need "General Cleaning" every 3-4 months ($30-$40/unit) and a "Chemical Wash" every 12-18 months ($80-$120). If a technician claims you need a "Gas Top-Up" on every visit, they are scamming you. A/C systems are sealed; gas only leaks if there is a puncture.

## Overview

Air conditioning in Brunei is life-support, not a luxury. An unmaintained unit will increase your electric bill by 15-25% and fail within 3 years. The local market is flooded with freelance technicians, ranging from excellent experts to "cowboys" who damage units with high-pressure jets.

This guide standardizes expectations for pricing, frequency, and scam detection, helping you build a "high density" understanding of your home's mechanical health.

## Key Information

| Service Type | Price Range (BND) | Frequency | What is Done? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **General Service** | $30 - $45 | Every 3-4 Months | Filter clean, cover wash, blower dust, tray flush. |
| **Chemical Wash** | $80 - $120 | Every 12-18 Months | Unit dismantle, chemical foam on coils, deep clean. |
| **Gas Top-up** | $20 - $50 | **NEVER** (unless leaked) | Adding R32/R410A refrigerant. |
| **Inspection** | $10 - $20 | As needed | Checking why unit is blinking/warm. |

### The "Gas Top-Up" Myth

> [!WARNING]
> **Air conditioning systems are closed loops.**
> Refrigerant (gas) is not "consumed" like petrol in a car. It circulates forever.
> If a technician says "Gas is low, need top up" -> **You have a leak.**
> *   **Correct Action**: Find and fix the leak (welding/tightening), *then* refill.
> *   **Incorrect Practice**: Topping up gas without fixing the leak. This is a temporary band-aid, not a repair.

## Step-by-Step Maintenance Strategy

### 1. The 3-Month Cycle (DIY Filter Clean)
You don't always need a pro.
*   **Monthly**: Open the cover, pull out the mesh filters.
*   **Wash**: Rinse with water in the bathroom. Let dry.
*   **Result**: airflow improves instantly, saving electricity.

### 2. The 4-Month Cycle (General Service)
Call a pro. Dust accumulates on the "blower wheel" (the spinning cylinder), making the aircon noisy and weak.
*   **Booking**: Book 3-4 days in advance. Saturdays are always full.
*   **Group Discount**: Servicing 3-4 units at once often drops the price to $30/unit vs $40 for a single unit.

### 3. The Troubleshooting Matrix

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Water Dripping** | Blocked drainage tray (Jelly build-up) | Vacuum drain pipe (General Service) |
| **Not Cold (Air is fan only)** | Capacitor dead OR Compressor dead | Part replacement ($50-$200) |
| **Not Cold (Air is weak)** | Dirty Blower Wheel | Chemical Wash needed |
| **Ice forming on pipes** | Low Gas (Leak) or Very Dirty | Leak check required |
| **Blinking Light** | Electronic/Sensor Error | Check error code (Google the blink count) |

## Service Providers landscape

*   **Established Companies**: These firms have physical offices, offer receipts, and provide workmanship warranties (usually 30 days). They are recommended for major repairs or corporate contracts where accountability is key.
    *   *Examples*: Major HVAC engineering firms listed in directories.
*   **Freelancers**: Found via social media or messengers. They are significantly cheaper ($25-$30) and effective for simple cleaning.
    *   *Risk*: Lack of warranty or accountability if a unit is damaged during cleaning.
*   **Booking Platforms**: Some service apps now offer fixed-price booking, which adds a layer of dispute resolution if something goes wrong.

## Costs and Pricing

`Planning estimate:` Budget **BND 150 per year per unit** for maintenance.

| Component | Cost | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **R32 Gas Refill** | $40 - $80 | Eco-friendly gas, slightly more expensive than R410A. |
| **Capacitor** | $35 - $65 | Commmon failure. Cheap part, mostly labor cost. |
| **PC Board Repair** | $150+ | Often better to buy a new aircon unit if it's old (5+ years). |
| **New 1HP Unit** | $350 - $450 | Price of new unit (excluding installation). |
| **Installation** | $80 - $120 | "Back-to-back" installation. Longer piping costs more. |

## Tips and Recommendations

*   **Standardize Your Brand**: Try to buy one brand (e.g., all Panasonic or all Daikin) for your house. It makes finding parts and remotes much easier.
*   **Inverter vs Non-Inverter**:
    *   **Inverter**: Saves electricity (bill is lower), but PC board is expensive to repair.
    *   **Non-Inverter**: "Dumb" and robust. cheap repair, higher electric bill. Good for rental properties.
*   **The "Chemical Overkill"**: Don't do chemical wash too often (e.g., every 3 months). The strong chemicals can corrode the cooling fins over time if not rinsed perfectly. Once a year is enough.

## The Mathematics of Cooling: Inverter vs Non-Inverter ROI

In Brunei, electricity is tiered (1st 600 units are cheap, then it gets expensive). Air conditioning is usually the largest component of your bill (60-70%).

### The Calculation
*   **Scenario**: Master Bedroom, ON for 10 hours/night (8pm - 6am).
*   **Non-Inverter (1.5HP)**: Consumes ~1.2 kWh per hour constant.
    *   Nightly: 12 kWh. Monthly: 360 kWh.
    *   Cost (at $0.08/unit avg): **$28.80 / month**.
*   **Inverter (1.5HP)**: Ramps down to ~0.4 kWh once rooms is cool.
    *   Nightly: ~5-6 kWh. Monthly: 180 kWh.
    *   Cost (at $0.08/unit avg): **$14.40 / month**.

**Result**: You save roughly **$15 per month ($180/year)** per unit.
*   **Cost Difference**: Inverter unit costs ~$150 more upfront.
*   **Break-even**: ~10 months. After that, it is pure profit.
*   *Note*: If you run the aircon 24/7 (living room), the savings are even higher.

## Health Density: The "Jelly" is Alive

When technicians talk about "jelly" in the water tray, they are referring to a **bio-film of algae, mold, and bacteria**.
*   **The Cycle**: Condensation (water) + Dust (food) + Dark Cool Environment = Perfect Mold Incubator.
*   **The Risk**: When the blower fan spins, it pushes air *through* this wet ecosystem. If you smell a "sour sock" smell, you are breathing mold spores.
*   **Prevention**: This is why the "Chemical Wash" is not just mechanical—it uses biocides to kill this film. For families with asthmatic children, this is not optional maintenance; it is health hygiene.

## Troubleshooting: The "Blinking Light" Decoder

Modern aircons communicate via blinking LEDs. Before you call a pro, count the blinks.
*   **Daikin/Panasonic**:
    *   **2 Blinks**: Sensor error (Room temp sensor).
    *   **Fast Blinking**: Signal error (Wiring between indoor/outdoor).
    *   **Timer Light Blinking**: High pressure protection (Dirty condenser outside).
*   *Pro Tip*: Turn off the main isolator switch (the big red switch on the wall) for 5 minutes. This "hard resets" the board. If it comes back, call a pro.

## Common Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Why is my aircon dripping water inside?**
A: The drainage pipe is clogged with algae/dust "jelly". A technician can vacuum this out in 15 minutes. It is rarely a broken part.

**Q: Which brand is best in Brunei?**
A: **Panasonic** and **Daikin** have the best spare parts availability. Brands like Carrier and Midea are decent budget options.

**Q: Can I install the aircon myself?**
A: No. It requires vacuum pumps, copper flaring tools, and pressure gauges. Bad installation is the #1 cause of leaks.

**Q: My remote screen is black?**
A: Change the batteries. If they leaked acid, buy a "Universal Remote" ($10 at any hardware store).

**Q: Does "General Service" include gas?**
A: No. And it shouldn't. If they add gas, ask why.

**Q: How long should a unit last?**
A: With regular cleaning: 7-10 years. Without cleaning: 3-4 years before the compressor overheats and dies.

## The Freelancer Vetting Protocol

Since you cannot rely on a brand name, you must rely on your own vetting process. When hiring a freelancer from Facebook or WhatsApp, ask these three questions before they arrive:

1.  **"Do you have a vacuum for the drain pipe?"**
    *   *Correct Answer*: "Yes."
    *   *Wrong Answer*: "No need, I just blow it." (This pushes the clog deeper).
2.  **"Do you offer a warranty on water leaking?"**
    *   *Correct Answer*: "Yes, 1 week / 1 month."
    *   *Wrong Answer*: "See first."
3.  **"What chemical do you use?"**
    *   *Correct Answer*: They can name a specific brand or type (Alkaline/Acidic).
    *   *Wrong Answer*: "Just normal chemical."

## Understanding the "Gas Loop" Myth

To reinforce why gas top-ups are widely misunderstood: imagine your car tires. You don't "top up" the rubber every month. The rubber is the container. If the tire is flat, there is a hole.
*   **The Closed Loop**: The copper pipes in your aircon are welded shut. The gas helps transfer heat. It never leaves the system.
*   **The Exception**: Micro-leaks can happen over 5-10 years due to vibration. But if a technician says you need gas *every* service, they are fundamentally incorrect.
