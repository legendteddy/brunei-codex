# Airport Transport Safety - Complete Guide

**Quick Answer:** Walking from Brunei International Airport is extremely dangerous due to highway barriers and lack of sidewalks. The safe, verified options are the Franchise Bus ($1, erratic schedule) or Dart Ride-Hailing (~$12, reliable). Plan to buy a SIM card at Arrivals to ensure you can book a Dart if the bus is delayed.

## Overview

Arriving in Brunei can be deceptive. The airport looks geographically close to nearby commercial areas like Times Square or Berakas, leading many visitors to attempt walking. **Do not do this.** The infrastructure exiting the airport is a high-speed dual carriageway designed exclusively for vehicular traffic. There are no sidewalks, no pedestrian crossings, and vehicles travel at 80-100km/h.

This guide provides the verified, safe alternatives. Your choice comes down to a trade-off between cost (Bus: $1) and certainty (Dart: ~$12). Because the bus schedule can be unpredictable, we recommend a "Bus-First, Dart-Backup" strategy supported by immediate connectivity (buying a SIM card).

## Key Information

| Transport Mode | Cost (BND) | Reliability | Best For |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Franchise Bus** | $1.00 | Variable (30-60 mins) | Solo travelers on a tight budget |
| **Dart (Ride App)** | $11.00 - $15.00 | High | Families, groups, or night arrivals |
| **Airport Taxi** | $25.00+ | High | those without a smartphone/app |
| **Walking** | Free | **DANGEROUS** | **NO ONE.** Strictly advised against. |

### Critical Safety Warning

> [!WARNING]
> **Do not attempt to walk.**
> Tourists often try to walk along the highway shoulder. This is a life-safety risk.
> *   **High Speed**: Cars merge at 80km/h+.
> *   **Heat**: 30°C+ heat and high humidity will induce exhaustion within 15 minutes.
> *   **Barriers**: Crash barriers often block the direct "map route," forcing you into traffic.

## Step-by-Step Process

### Option 1: The "Bus-First" Strategy (Cheapest)

If you are budget-conscious, try the bus, but have a limit on how long you wait.

1.  **Exit Arrivals**: Go to the Ground Floor Arrivals Hall.
2.  **Turn LEFT**: Do not cross the road yet. Walk left along the curbside.
3.  **Walk to End**: Go past the taxi stand to the very end of the driveway (near the car park entrance).
4.  **Locate Bus Bay**: Look for the pillar/sign marking the bus stop.
5.  **Wait Limit**: If the bus does not appear within 30 minutes, switch to Option 2.

**Bus Lines**: 23, 24, 34, 36, 38 (All loop to BSB Terminal).
**Frequency**: Officially every 30 minutes, but often 45-60 minutes in practice.
**Payment**: Cash only ($1 notes preferred). Drivers rarely have change for large notes.

### Option 2: Dart Ride-Hailing (Recommended)

This is the most seamless way to leave the airport.

1.  **Get Connected**: Buy a SIM card (DST/Progresif) in the Arrivals Hall *before* going outside. You need data.
2.  **Download App**: Install **Dart Brunei**.
3.  **Book Ride**: Set pickup to "Brunei International Airport - Arrivals".
4.  **Meet Driver**: The app will show the car plate. Meet them at the designated pickup lane (usually near the middle/right).

### Option 3: Airport Taxi (Fastest Manual)

If you don't have a phone/data, use the official taxi queue.

1.  **Locate Queue**: Directly in front of Arrivals exit.
2.  **Confirm Rate**: Ask if it is metered or a fixed zone rate.
3.  **Payment**: Cash is strictly preferred.

## Luggage Considerations

*   **Buses**: Franchise buses are standard size. You can bring luggage, but if the bus is crowded during peak hours (5pm), it can be awkward. There is no dedicated luggage rack.
*   **Dart Cars**: most Dart vehicles are sedans (Vios, Cerato). Only 2 large suitcases will fit in the trunk. If you are a group of 3-4 with large bags, you **must order two cars** or specifically request a larger vehicle if the app option allows.
*   **Taxis**: Airport taxis are often older Mercedes or similar large sedans with generous trunk space, better suited for heavy luggage.

## Night Arrival Protocols (After 8:00 PM)

Brunei is not a late-night city.
*   **Buses**: Stop running completely around 8:00 PM. Do not wait for a bus if you land after 7:30 PM.
*   **Dart**: Drivers are fewer late at night. You might wait 15-20 minutes for a car.
*   **SIM Card Counters**: Usually open until the last flight, but if they are closed, you will be stuck without data. In this specific case, use the **Airport Taxi** as your failsafe.

## The Connectivity Strategy (SIM Card)

The most important step for safety is **connectivity**.
*   **Location**: DST and Progresif counters are located *inside* the Arrivals Hall, commonly on the right side as you exit customs.
*   **Cost**: "Tourist Sims" are around BND $15-$25 and come with ~10GB data.
*   **Why**: It allows you to check Google Maps, book a Dart, or call your hotel. WiFi at the airport works *inside*, but drops the moment you step onto the curb to find your car.

## Costs and Pricing

`Planning estimate:` The price gap is significant ($1 vs $15), but so is the convenience.

| Component | Cost | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Bus Fare** | $1.00 | Fixed flat rate. No transfer ticket. |
| **Dart Fare** | $11.00 - $15.00 | Varies by distance and demand. |
| **SIM Card** | ~$10.00 - $25.00 | Essential for Dart. Valid for 1-4 weeks. |
| **Taxi Fare** | $25.00+ | Often higher than Dart due to surcharges. |

## Tips and Recommendations

*   **The SIM Card Rule**: Always buy your SIM at the airport. It solves the transport problem immediately.
*   **"Reality Check" on Buses**: Timetables are often not posted or outdated. Frequency feels like "every 45 minutes" rather than "every 20 minutes."
*   **Cash is King**: For buses and taxis, keep small notes ($1, $5). Drivers rarely have change for $50 or $100.
*   **Night Arrivals**: Buses stop running around 8:00 PM. If you arrive late, download Dart immediately or pre-arrange a hotel transfer.
*   **Rain**: If it is raining heavily, the bus stop walk is partially exposed. A Dart pickup is under the roof. Choose comfort.

## Common Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Can I just walk to the nearest shops?**
A: No. The nearest shops (airport mall/Times Square) are separated by highway barriers. It is not a walkable distance safely.

**Q: Does Uber or Grab work in Brunei?**
A: No. Brunei has its own app called **Dart**. It works exactly the same way.

**Q: Do buses take credit cards?**
A: No. Cash only. BND $1.00 per ride.

**Q: Is there free WiFi at the airport to book a Dart?**
A: Yes, "Airport Free WiFi" usually works in the Arrivals Hall, but signal drops quickly outside. A SIM card is safer.

**Q: How long is the drive to the city center (BSB)?**
A: About 15-20 minutes by car. 30-45 minutes by bus depending on stops.
